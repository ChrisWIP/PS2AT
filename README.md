# PS2AT
This project makes up a small PCB that you can use to connect an older AT style motherboard with a newer (easier to find) PS/2 keyboard.

Solder some pins taken from a pin header to the bottom of the board that correspond with your motherboards original AT connector after you remove it.

Next solder on a standard PS/2 socket to the other space on the PCB. 

The surface mount footprint is for a 100nF capacitor if you feel the need.

Though untested, the opposite of installing an AT connector for a PS2 keyboard with this adapter should also be possoble where room exists on the motherboard.

NB: cut the pins going up from the AT motherboard to the adapter board flush at the top and ENSURE THAT NOTHING SHORTS OUT on the shielding of the PS2 connector.
